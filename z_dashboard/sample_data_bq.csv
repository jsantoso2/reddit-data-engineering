Shopify tracking. It came today when I'm at work. It needs a signature and I told my family it might come they went to lunch. How am I suppose to know it was coming when they were wrong yesterday and the fedex site says it'll come tomarrow but it somehow is also out for delivery AND in a town an hour away. It's Also so heavy they can't hold it near me so I can pick it up myself the closest place is like 45 min. To an hour away. The CS bot is aweful. Hung up on me. And won't give me to a person. 3/4 people were helpful but literally couldn't help me only ask me questions and give me info that there was no help they could give. Least the 4th guy was like honestly no one is out now they can't come back to deliver it and when I asked who can I yell at told me just try my local fed ex store. 50 minutes missed the dude by 50 minutes. Now next business day I have to be at an appointment then meet my friend so when can I be there to get my shipment when I have no idea when it's gonna come. This entire process has put me off any business that uses fed ex. I see nice fed ex people all the time now ill have to contain rage. It's not there fault but man am I pissed.,Home Del.

Not to flip you out but I’d say it’s been 5 months ago I had a ground shipment take almost 6 weeks to finally get to me it was coming from California to Virginia so it was so so many scans popping Up along way it finally made it a few states from mine and sat there then it popped up finally in my state outta no where ! It can’t be real unpredictable most likely yours will get to you within a week or tow if luck and it’s not a holiday of bad weather for months at time .

Wednesday part confuses me. It looks like it was van scanned onto the truck for delivery. They got to the Hold At Location (HAL)? Sometimes the device will allow the driver to redirect the package to a HAL without the shipper/recipients authorization. Since it’s in the “don’t deliver” option for packages needing a signature, usually for a phone. My assumption is that they went to the HAL location and when they tried to release the package, it prevented them from doing it. This is from international packages, because they didn’t get customs clearance, for lack of paperwork. That’s unfortunately on the shipper end not sending the commercial invoice. It’s weird because if I VAN scan those packages into the truck it says “not cleared for delivery” which should have been left at the station on Wednesday.Thursday/Friday driver probably saw the package and assumed it still had a problem, left it on belt to be seen by station agents, to attempt to correct issue.The scan for Saturday is actually pretty normal. Your package is set as a weekday delivery, those packages usually don’t make it to the truck/ often left behind at station.TLDR possibly a customs issue(?) on an international shipment preventing release.Probably should call 1800gofedex and see what’s the issue being four days (wed/thrs/fri/mon)Could also attempt to drive to the shipping center, if that’s within reasonable commute, and pick it up yourself.",t3_we4jft,t3_we4jft,2022-08-02T12:12:18Z,1,1,1,0,https://preview.redd.it/oi22lbr7x8f91.png?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=961993f4fd03d1a1c0fc3585387ef6189f7b7ca4,

And most don’t give a shit about your specific package. They’re running the route they’re getting paid to do, and most aren’t getting paid well. All depends on the contractor and route/number of stops. If there are specific instructions like “back door” or “side door” or “leave under x”, if it’s actually typed in correctly, it should print on out the label. Or it might get picked up by an admin scan and they can put it on there. But for most packages that won’t happen, and it just ends up getting to the driver and they (should) deliver it as normal with any other package. NOW, I would definitely recommend getting to know your route driver(s) if you can, because some of them are great people. I had plenty whose regulars would give them snacks and drinks and whatnot. And the people that cared for them and got to know them, generally got better service. “Hey could you leave x package behind the grill?” Done. Etc etc. To answer your question, no, most delivery instructions won’t get to the drivers. There’s a separation from Ground to the contractors and it mostly never gets communicated through P&D, pick and delivery.",t3_wesciu,t3_wesciu,2022-08-03T01:08:12Z,1,1,0,0,,

Many drivers will be hesitant to open up a gate or walk behind a house. Most packages are released at a front or side door for a house and a mailroom/leasing office for apartments. A posted note on your front door for drivers to release elsewhere will most likely catch their attention then our scanners.TLDR: It is listed, but many times overlooked because the drivers are in routine to close the stop out and will default to front or side door to houses and mailrooms and leasing offices for apartments.

If you have a late on the 10:30/12:00 and the driver delivery a 4:30/8:00 package, they get a write up which leads to termination.However, if the driver mixes commitment times, they go home early. ( no 10:30/12:00 lates)By 12:00 the driver should have finished all priority (10:30/12:00), either will go straight onto lunch (30minute or 1hour), and start clearing neighborhood.Business 10:30 must have a same day second attempt.  12:00 residential are not required.First overnight packages- business same day second attempt, residential I’m not 100% but I think it’s just one attempt per day. First overnight are 8:30, and given to a separate driver with only first overnight. Then they get rushed back to station, and ‘attempted’ to be given to your regular route driver. I say ‘attempted’ since it might not make it back in time, which means it gets sent with a PM driver….. there is no telling when, best guess 6pmEverything is set on a one attempt, three day-3( expect 10:30 three days, two days -6)TLDR It’s just a when the driver will get back to your neighborhood. 12:00 they should be done with priority and working ‘other’ deliveries. 100deliveries for me I finished by 4:30… but I’m also fast *shrugs*",t3_wg06ze,t3_wg06ze,2022-08-04T14:48:13Z,1,3,0,0,,

Most FedEx drivers are paid per stop or a flat rate per day.",t3_wh9jbp,t3_wh9jbp,2022-08-06T09:48:29Z,1,2,0,0,,

But once again, the package isn't there, there was never a Fed Ex truck at my house at all. I then look at the tracking info and it says it was indeed delivered on the 1st at noon, exactly 2 days prior to me getting the email and text saying it was just delivered. I then call the automated customer service numerous times until I can finally get through to someone and have a case started and they put it on priority, took my email, phone number, address and told me if it didn't come by the 4th, to then call again. I didn't get it still, and on the 4th called and was told that my case had been closed and wouldn't tell me anything else. I had to call tech support just to finally transfer me to someone on the phone for customer service, I told them my tracking number and they told me the case was closed because they couldn't find my package and that's all I got from them. I asked them what else they could do and asked if they even had record of getting the package in the first place or why none of the tracking info made sense or why it send me delivery notifications 2 days after said it was delivered, they gave me no Info at all, they wouldn't tell me anything other than to contact the seller (Valve Corporation). I have contacted them and I was told they were looking into it as well, but to contact Fed Ex as to why they lost my package and what they can do to rectify it. I'm at my wit's end here, this whole thing is incredibly frustrating and I've been very calm and polite about this to the people I was talking to on the phone but it's gotten me nowhere and I've already spend so much time on this as well as the money that it's infuriating.

Did you contract separately with FedEx or did you pay shipping and handling directly to Valve or was the shipping included with purch price? Probably paid everything thru Valve.FedEx is NOT who you should be calling. In all likelihood you have no business with FedEx, you paid FedEx ZERO DOLLARS and zero cents. You do not understand your relationship at all. If you paid VALVE Corp. That's who your beef is with! Valve Corp PAID FedEx. Valve is the BAILOR, FedEx is the BAILEE. You are the customer of Valve, Valve is the customer of FedEx.If you were smart (we have no evidence of that thus far) you would get on the phone to VALVE and explain how long you patiently waited in line, and how long you patiently waited for delivery, And you don't care if FedEx lost your package, that is not your problem that is Valves problem! You're not going to wait any longer and you don't give a f\*ck if FedEx or UPS or USPS lost the pkg, NOT YOUR PROBLEM!You explain to them that THEY contracted with FedEx, you didn't! As it stands you're out $700 plus shipping and you have no intention of waiting any longer. They will be sending the very next deck they get their slimy little hands on to YOU, and they will send it Express delivery, signature required! If they don't send one out immediately, your next call will be to the State Attorney Generals Office.Consumers have rights. FedEx's problems are not your problems, that is a separate issue between Valve and FedEx and you should not be penalized due to their malfeasance.In the digital age, consumers should not have to suffer behind online sellers who say, ""Not my problem, shipper F'd up."" If Valve had a local store you would walk down to the store and register your complaint in person.  You do not surrender your rights because you buy online!Good Luck",t3_whsnkn,t3_whsnkn,2022-08-07T05:05:07Z,1,6,0,0,,

You get some fans to push around the warm salty air with the dust particles. Some fans are above us but even then, can have them on full blast because the vision labels fly off. So as I was saying. We unload those pkgs, send them up the tower, 30ft up in that WH,  to split them, then off to the belt of departure. Or we unloading in a trailer that has no windows or fan. Just open in the rear, constantly bending side to side  moving pkgs thru. NO AIR CONDITIONING!!  We have a conveyer system that only stops, does not slow down.  Ok let's say SOME bulk pkgs that's like 6, 12 pkgs on the belt at same time, so we are running in and out of the truck, to place the boxes where they go.
