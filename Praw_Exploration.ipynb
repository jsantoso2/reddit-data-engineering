If the status hasn't changed from that, FedEx never got it.\n",

      "**On Truck For Delivery:** Most likely, yes! There is always something that could happen, but it happens to a very small number of packages (in comparison to the total done by FedEx). With only a tiny bit of good fortune, you should indeed have your package today!\n",

      "Text Body:  I had a package lost about 5 days ago (it says delivered but my apartment front desk says no delivery was made at that time) and before I get even angrier I was wondering how the tracing works? From what they told me on the initial call they would just reach out to the driver and they would see the GPS location of where they delivered the box to. To me that seems like it would take 5 minutes, especially since they said they would contact me by tomorrow latest (tomorrow being the day after it was lost). Does it actually go into some huge tracing backlog instead? That would make more sense as to why it’s taking so long so I’m just curious. It’s obvious they will no longer find it, but I can’t order a new one until it’s deemed officially lost (if they even own up to the mistake).\n",

      "Title:  Would this be considered fraud? FedEx is lying to me.\n",
      "Text Body:  Hello. I'm reaching out to ask a question about an experience I had recently. I ordered a package from Adidas and they used Fedex Ground as their delivery service. On the day of the delivery I was expecting the package to be delivered to my door as per usual since those are my delivery instructions. Instead, I got a message from Fedex specifically stating that my package was left in the mail room of my apartment complex. I thought ok then I'll just have to walk over and get it later. I didn't stress going and getting the package immediately, because they literally said it was inside the mail room which means it isn't going to get stolen. Well a few hours later I was able to leave my home office and I walked to the mail room and they said they hadn't gotten any packages. I thought this was strange so I contacted Adidas who told me that they may have delivered it to the mail room of a different apartment complex or maybe it was still on the delivery truck and that they would contact Fedex about it. 48 hours later I am told that the driver left my package, not inside any room at all, but on the curb completely outside next to the trash pickup. By this point, the package is gone and has been either stolen or mistaken for trash. I've been trying to talk to Adidas and Fedex for weeks now to be reimbursed for an improperly delivered package, but neither of them are willing to take responsibility and issue a refund for the package. They are saying the package was successfully delivered even though they basically dropped it off in the middle of a parking lot nowhere near my side of the apartment complex and then lied about leaving it there by saying it was in the mail room. My question is, is this considered fraud? I've tried to work with both Fedex and Adidas and I'm getting nowhere, so my next option will be contacting my bank to see if they can help me, because I have various types of proof that I've been lied to about my package.\n",

Also we don’t just go you your house and your neighbors house we go to 160-200 houses daily even the most physically fit person is going to take some shortcuts. like someone said we usually have a good idea of what is and is not fragile. I know it really seems like a no brainer for every package to be handled in the most perfect way but it just can’t be like that. That’s why all parcels are insured, human error is hard to correct for.\n",

If the plane is late to the hub with all the packages you shipped it is late leaving which means it may not make it to the destination on time no matter where it is going. All the planes leave from the safe place so they would all be delayed a day regardless of where they were going if they all came from the same place. It all depends on when the plane arrived during the sort at the facility. They are not going to hold the plane for late arrivals. They will just bump them to the next flight even if it is the next day.\n",
